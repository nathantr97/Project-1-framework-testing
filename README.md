# Bookemons

## Description

♪ I wanna be the very best

Like no one ever was

To catch them is my real test

To train them is my cause

I will travel across the land

Searching far and wide

Teach Pokémon to understand

The power that's inside ♪

## User Story 

AS A Pokemon and book lover <br>
I WANT to add randomized Pokemons and my favorite books to a reading timeline <br>
